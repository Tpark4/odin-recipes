   <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Renowned for its fluffy, cotton-like texture, and a cross between souffle and the infamous New York
   Cheesecake, this Japanese Cheesecake has continued to be a crowd-pleasing dessert since the 60s.
  Egg Whites are the secret behind its jiggly-fluffy texture and it is baked in a bain-marie,
  or water bath, for gentle and even heating in the oven.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>100g butter</li>
   <li>100g cream cheese</li>
   <li>130ml (1/2 cup) of milk</li>
   <li>8 egg yolks</li>
   <li>60g flour</li>
   <li>60g cornstarch</li>
   <li>13 large egg whites</li>
   <li>130g sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
   <p><li>Mix the butter, cream cheese, and milk into a pot and cook it over low heat. Continue to
       stir until the mixture is smooth and thick.</li></p>
       <p><li>Whisk the egg yolks together in a bowl and gradually whisk in the mixture.</li></p>
       <p><li>Sift the flour and cornstarch over the batter and stir until smooth and shiny.</li></p>
      <p><li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites together until soft peaks form. Then, add sugar
           to form a meringue with somewhat stiff peaks. (Gradually pour sugar into 3 parts to ensure
       that all of the sugar is dissolved into the meringue.</li></p>
           <p><li>Gradually fold the meringue into the batter, quarter parts at a time. Be gentle as the
               fluffiness of the cheesecake depends on the amount of air inside the mixture, so you
               don't want to use too much pressure.</li></p>
              <p><li>Transfer the mixture into a round greased baking pan lined with parchment paper.
                   Tap the pan against the table to remove any air bubbles inside.</li></p>
                   <p><li>Place the baking pan over a wider baking dish and fill the outer
                       tray with hot water until it's about 2cm high.</li></p>
                       <p><li>Bake the cheesecake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes at 320F (160c) then
                           reduce heat to 284F (140c) and bake it for another 55 minutes.</li></p>
                           <p><li>Once the cheesecake is baked, carefully invert the cake onto your hand
                               and remove it from the baking pan. While you can invert it onto a plate,
                               this will cause the cake to deflate even more.</li></p>
                              <p><li>Serve the cake with a layer of powdered sugar and freshly sliced fruits of your choice.</li></p>
  </ol>
